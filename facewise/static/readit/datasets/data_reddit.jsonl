Japos pajeros.\n* Si bien la mayor\u00eda muestra precios en CLP, no significa que te vayan a cobrar en tarjeta de cr\u00e9dito nacional. Por ejemplo, comprar en Steam directamente se cobra en d\u00f3lares (t. internacional), mientras que mediante Boa es en pesos, pero sin devoluci\u00f3n.\n\nTL;DR:\n\n* Si quiere jugar alguna consola y tiene poca plata, la Xbox Series S es buena alternativa.\n* Si tiene plata, PC.\n* Nintendo Switch vale la pena por los exclusivos y por poder llevar la consola a todos lados.\n* PlayStation es MUY caro en sus consolas y juegos en Chile. Vale la pena s\u00f3lo por los exclusivos, y ya hay varios en Steam! Manso pico en el ojo que nos est\u00e1n metiendo wn.

(Also it was really fun answering questions, it made me feel like a celebrity for the day)\n\nDuring the pandemic, I...\n\n- Survived brain surgery for a rare brain disease called Moyamoya disease. ([See gallery here, make sure to read the captions. WARNING: a bit gory/gross](https://imgur.com/gallery/VeKzyM2))\n- Fell in love with my current extremely awesome super supportive girlfriend. [Here she is helping me at a local holiday market](https://imgur.com/gallery/QlnLLQt)\n- Successfully funded [my first ever boardgame](https://sysifuscorp.com/) on Kickstarter and [sold a bunch of copies thanks to Reddit](https://imgur.com/gallery/zaLwHoo).\n- Made [a card game](https://www.sharehomethegame.com/) about mythical creatures living together in a reality TV show (inspired by my love for Terrace House)\n- Was featured in the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/02/18/leaving-corporate-america-creative-job-own-boss/) as part of their \"people who quit their corporate jobs to do something else\" article. And [here is a picture](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/t0lxuz/oc_my_immigrant_parents_reacting_to_an_article_of/) of my immigrant parents reacting to seeing me in the newspaper.\n\nSome other random notable stuff I've done in the last year:\n- [clocked over 300 hours of Nintendo Switch gaming](https://imgur.com/gallery/gn4gizg), and probably equal if not more for PS4 (but they don't show you that data)\n- got COVID despite being vaccinated.\n- moved to Astoria NYC. I even participated as a [vendor in the local holiday market](https://preview.redd.it/o2t0ofb37y381.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0a8a85bafdc4e58c62263b8cfc213779d6ac6ab).\n- [made a really cool loft bed](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/sdnb2n/a_loft_bed_with_storage_nook_underneath/). and a [foldable coffee table](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/t0q2a0/making_a_foldable_coffee_table/). and a [really long computer desk](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/scujip/making_a_super_long_computer_desk_for_me_and_my_gf/).\n- [had my game available for sale at a local artist's collective](https://imgur.com/gallery/0OPy6mk).\n- went to my first ever [boardgame convention (Pax Unplugged 2021)](https://imgur.com/gallery/G7hfWnt)\n- turned 30.\n- was on the [Jackson Hole livestream](https://imgur.com/gallery/iuoFLxZ) during my family trip to Yellowstone.\n\n\n\n----\n\nThe last time I wrote out an AMA post, I was amazed to see how much stuff I've accomplished when looking back. And even though it's only been a year since my last post, it still feels so weird to  type this out and see how much stuff I've done since then.\n\nHaving survived brain surgery, it kinda feels like I have a renewed lease on my life. Almost like, if I survived that, then maybe everything will be alright, you know? Kinda like the stuff I did leading up to the pandemic was my origin story and this past year was my \"year 2.\" (i dunno i just saw batman and its fresh on my mind lol)\n\nAnyways, if you know anyone with Moyamoya Disease, please encourage them to [join our Facebook group!](https://www.facebook.com/groups/145861575578487/)\n\nOh and if you want some [free stickers click here](https://sharehomethegame.com/freesticker). :)\n\n[Proof I'm me](https://twitter.com/sysifuscorp/status/1501961785884168194).\n\nThanks for reading and please AMA!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "IAmA", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qzb6", "subreddit_subscribers": 21795335, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "During the pandemic, I survived brain surgery, fell in love, made two board games, and was featured in the Washington Post!

This thing is in rough shape, so if you're collector, I'd avoid it. The screens have some slight damage to them. I'll include any one of the listed 3DS games that are $10 or under if you'd like a game with the console. Decent option to CFW and give to a kid, or something.   \nTime stamps here: https://imgur.com/a/0RSvLza\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n*Used* **Nintendo \"New\" 3DS XL (Galaxy / Purple Colorway) -- $205.00 Local / $225.00 Shipped**        \nExcellent condition. Can easily be CFW'ed. No charger. I'll include any one of the listed 3DS games that are $10 or under if you'd like a game with the console. The new 3DS xl has the better processing power.   \nTime stamps here: https://imgur.com/a/vjNZLUz\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n*Used* **New 3DS JPN Region (Black Colorway) + Monster Hunter X / Cross JPN Region -- $210.00 Local / $230.00 Shipped**     \nExcellent condition. Can easily be CFW'ed. Includes Monster Hunter X Cross The new 3DS has the better processing power. No charger. This is a JPN Region console, the menu is in Japanese, and on stock firmware, it can only play Japanese 3DS games. However, with CFW, you can change the region and language and play any games from any region.  \nTime stamps here: https://imgur.com/a/g1uidyn\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n*Used* **Xbox One X (Robot White Colorway) System and Games Bundle --  $245.00 Local / $280.00 Shipped**     \nThe Xbox One X bundle includes the console, the controller, a third party HDMI cable, and third party power cable. The box and all original paperwork are included. There is some damage to the paint on the side of the Xbox from a removable stand. The controller will not come with the double-A batteries, so you'll need to provide them yourself. Also includes used copies of *Assassins Creed: Origins* and *Fallout: 76*. I will not separate the games from the bundle, because I'd like to get rid of them.   \nTime Stamps here: https://imgur.com/a/M3xvKlJ \n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n*New* **Nintendo Switch OLED (White colorway) + Metroid Dread: Special Edition + Metroid Dread amiibo 2-pack -- $480.00 Local Only**      \n*Price is 349.99 Console + 89.99 Game + 29.99 Amiibos + 10 for gas = $480*. Shipping this thing will make it too expensive and not worth it for a buyer, so for now I am only offering this for local cash only. I will not part out this bundle unless you're willing to pay a decent premium. Everything is in great condition and brand new. Local only.     \nTime Stamps here: (upon request)\n\n------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------\n\n*New* **Pok\u00e9mon SoulSilver -- $500.00 Local / $580.00 Shipped**   \nPokemon Soul Silver: See photos. Includes everything pictured. Will be shipped priority and signature confirmation and insured and incredibly well packaged. The \"small box\" inside is sealed, outer box inspected to make sure everything is included. Comes in a plastic protector shell. Timestamps from July (except for the most recent timestamp). I can open it up again and take new photos if you'd like. Pokemon SoulSilver in this condition is hard to find these days.      \nTimestamps here: https://imgur.com/a/HeXeOJv\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n*Used* **Pok\u00e9mon Emerald -- $105.00 Local / $120.00 Shipped**      \nPokemon Emerald: Authentic, dry battery. Works well, used to be my \"play\" copy of the game until I switched to an EZ-Flash for my GBA games. Save file will be wiped before sending it out. Contacts are a little dirty from age.\nTimestamps here: https://imgur.com/a/CKnUX5t   \n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n*Used* **Pok\u00e9mon Eon Ticket &amp; GBA e-Reader -- $270.00 Local / $300.00 Shipped**\nUsed, functional, and tested Eon Ticket and GBA e-Reader. Only sold as a bundle. To use the Eon Ticket, you'll need two GBA systems and a link cable, and Pokemon Ruby or Sapphire. Everything works, as I put eon tickets on my personal copies of Ruby and Sapphire. Awesome collectable for those interested.

I'm Timothy from the USA and I am requesting a game I have wanted for a very long time; Fallout 3 GOTY edition. This is my fifth attempt at requesting this because I don't plan on giving up on getting it. First a bit about myself. I'm 19 years old with blond hair and greyish blue eyes. I live in Colorado Springs with my family, my cats and my dog. I enjoy roguelikes, open-world games, fps(sometimes) and soulslike/metroidvania games. I also really enjoy rpgs and lego games. I am still a relatively new Steam user as I joined only two years ago but my account is level 4 because I don't know how to level it up. My main gaming platforms are Nintendo Switch and Steam. I can't purchase it myself because I'm currently focusing on graduating high school and can't get a job at the moment and my parents don't buy stuff for me very often \n\n\nThe game is $8.99 on Fanatical and the story of Fallout 3 takes place in the year 2277 in Washington D.C. Or what's left of it anyway. The gist of the story of Fallout 3 if you haven't heard it yet is that basically a huge nuclear war happened in the year 2077 and you're a survivor from a vault, in this case vault 101. When you come out of the vault, you realize that the world you once knew is no more and that you were gone for 200 years. Also before the war, the people relied on nuclear energy instead of electricity. As you explore this post-apocalyptic wasteland you start to see that certain creatures underwent changes. Once small insects and rodents have mutated into large aggressive beasts, Humans have mutated into mindless feral ghouls and Apex predators such as bears are even more deadly.\n\n\nBefore you do this however, you experience the main character's childhood. You decide your appearance by using something called a Gene Projection conducted by your father before your mother dies. Afterwards your father will remove his surgeon's mask to reveal a face similar to yours. After this you become a child and you are given a book titled \"You're SPECIAL!\" This is where you decide your core attributes. You receive a bb gun and a pip boy 3000 later during childhood and your performance in various tests determines other attributes. And that's all I know for now about the main story.\n\nOkay now onto the dlcs that are included with the GOTY edition. I will summarize these in one sentence.\n\nOperation Anchorage: It takes place in a Military simulation where you are stripped of your gear and given replacement gear.\n\nThe Pitt: Allows you to journey to the industrial raider town known as The Pitt aka the remains of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nBroken Steel: Pretty much a QOL thing that lets you continue playing past the end of the main questline.\n\nPoint Lookout: takes place in point lookout point state park in Maryland and has weird swamp creatures.\n\nMothership Zeta: you and a bunch of other people get abducted by aliens and have to work together to escape.\n\n\nNow here are the ten reasons I want the main game:\n\n\nThe Fallout games have nearly unlimited replayability.\n\n\nI have not played it yet and really would like to.\n\n\nI've heard incredibly good things about it and it's reviews are mostly positive.\n\n\nThe weapons are top notch and look fun to use.\n\n\nThe enemies are cool looking and look incredibly unique.\n\n\nThe Story is gripping and hooks you straight away.\n\n\nAll of the dlcs are top notch and are very well made.\n\n\nI have played Fallout 4 and want to know the stuff that happens before Fallout 4.\n\n\nAnd most importantly it's a game I have wanted since I became a Steam user.\n\n\n\nHere are the three reasons I want the Operation Anchorage dlc: It focuses on an event in fallout's history, mainly an event that happened before the great war where the US army liberated Anchorage, Alaska from Chinese forces.The pack contains quests, weapons and other cool stuff. And finally gameplay within the simulation is different from the main game as certain stations refill ammo and health among other changes. Kind of like metroid now that I think about it.\n\n\n\nNext up is three reasons I want The Pitt dlc:\n\n\nIt's a big new area that is the remains of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania that's crawling with raiders and goodies. There is new armor and clothing items based around post apocalyptic designs. And there is around 4 to 5 hours of gameplay quest-wise. Plus I love killing things in games. And this dlc will give me tons of stuff to kill.\n\n\n\nThree reasons for me wanting the Broken Steel dlc are that it adds some of the best weapons to the game.\n\n\nIt also raises the level cap from 20 to 30. And finally you get to continue playing past the main questline. So basically new game+.\n\n\n\nNext the three reasons I would like the Point Lookout dlc: It's a massive new area to explore with all of it being explorable. Yeah, no red mountain b.s(Looking at you Skyrim, damn you for not letting me go up to Red Mountain). There are new mobs that are swamp themed and new weapons that they can drop. And finally the lore is very compelling; It takes place in Point Lookout State Park in Maryland where no bombs were dropped on it, but the place nonetheless degenerated into a place just as unforgiving as the capital wasteland. Humanity left it behind and it became a swamp wasteland(Wonder if this is where Shrek is after the war?).\n\n\n\nAnd last but not least, there are some reasons I want the Mothership Zeta dlc: There are tons of new things and over 5 hours of gameplay. You get abducted by aliens and you have to work with the other abductees to escape. The way you get abducted is through following a distress signal to an alien crash site. It's here where you are beamed up by an alien mothership. You meet dozens of other abductees here having been abducted from tons of different centuries. There's a Japanese Samurai and a caveman to name a few. You work with these people to get to the bridge so you can escape.\n\n\n\nAnd that's everything! I hope that I made my point clear when gushing about the details. Thank you for reading and have a wonderful day!\n\n\nmy profile: https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198952271153/\n\nthe game: https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/fallout-3-game-of-the-year-edition", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "GiftofGames", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tb4r", "subreddit_subscribers": 133400, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "[REQUEST][STEAM] Fallout 3 GOTY edition on sale for $8.99 on Fanatical", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/t9sm5p/requeststeam_fallout_3_goty_edition_on_sale_for/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}

Out of the four systems, I like my Xbox Series X more. \n\nAlthough I have been a Playstation guy since the year 2000, owned all Playstation consoles except the Vita, this generation, I've become a solid Xbox Series X/S fan. \n\nHere are some of the reasons why I fell in love with the Series X: \n\n#1 Game Pass Ultimate \n\nGame Pass Ultimate is the Netflix of video games. With this subscription, you get to to try different genre of games may it be FPS, 3rd person adventure, RTS, indie side scrollers and several other more. One of the best feature of this service is that you get to play day one Exclusive games. This year, one of the biggest games that is coming to the Xbox is Starfield. \n\n#2 Regional pricing \n\nOne of the perks of having an Xbox is the regional pricing. Since PH is not included in most of gaming services such as the PS Store and Nintendo Eshop, we of course have the freedom to choose which region we get to buy our games. Some games offer super prices. During the Black Friday sale, since I have spent less from using Game Pass, I was able to save and buy a lot of games from the Xbox Store- Crysis 1-3 Remastered for 500 pesos, Witcher 3 GOTY for 60 pesos, Farcry 3-6 for 1500 pesos. Recently, I bought Elden Ring for only 1500 pesos. This method may be unacceptable for other people, but it's a legit way for others to buy and try more games. \n\n#3 Key features \nConsidered as the most powerful console ever, the Xbox Series X provides several features that maximizes my gaming experience especially that I own the best gaming TV awardee last year, the LG C1 OLED - Higher resolution games, One X enhanced last gen games, Smart Delivery, Dolby Atmos/DTS Ultra Audio, Dolby Vision and VRR. \n\nThese are only some of the reasons why I love the Xbox Series X. Though I like every bit of my Series X, it is not a perfect console and here's why: \n\nNumber one, we are not sure if the future Xbox games will be GOTY contenders. One of Playstation's perks and biggest attractions is the games. Every PS exclusive is a GOTY contender. A buyer will surely enjoy a PS exclusive game. Unfortunately for Xbox, last generation was rough as they have not released a lot of exclusive games which should be sequels by now in this generation. They have lost their momentum from the 360 era and focused too much on other stuff and not get to see solid new games. \n\nNumber two, sharing/recording clips is a hassle as you can only record a 1080p clip for a minute max, without voice recording.(you need to insert a flash drive just to record for an hour). \n\nLastly,\u00a0 the community is small and very hard to find players in this country if you want to play MP/coop. Also most retail stores usually do not release most physical game discs at day one. \n\nComment your thoughts on the Xbox Series X/S. Let's keep the comment section healthy.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "PHGamers", "subreddit_id": "t5_31q6q", "subreddit_subscribers": 23105, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Xbox Series X/S is underrated in this country", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PHGamers/comments/t9rikr/xbox_series_xs_is_underrated_in_this_country/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}

And finally the lore is very compelling; It takes place in Point Lookout State Park in Maryland where no bombs were dropped on it, but the place nonetheless degenerated into a place just as unforgiving as the capital wasteland. Humanity left it behind and it became a swamp wasteland(Wonder if this is where Shrek is after the war?). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd last but not least, there are some reasons I want the Mothership Zeta dlc: There are tons of new things and over 5 hours of gameplay. You get abducted by aliens and you have to work with the other abductees to escape. The way you get abducted is through following a distress signal to an alien crash site. It's here where you are beamed up by an alien mothership. You meet dozens of other abductees here having been abducted from tons of different centuries. There's a Japanese Samurai and a caveman to name a few. You work with these people to get to the bridge so you can escape.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that's everything! I hope that I made my point clear when gushing about the details. Thank you for reading and have a wonderful day!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nmy profile: [https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198952271153/](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198952271153/)\n\nthe game: [https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/fallout-3-game-of-the-year-edition](https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/fallout-3-game-of-the-year-edition)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "GiftofGames", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tb4r", "subreddit_subscribers": 133401, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "[REQUEST][STEAM] Fallout 3 GOTY edition on sale for 8.99 on Fanatical[FIFTH ATTEMPT]", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/t9p5vi/requeststeam_fallout_3_goty_edition_on_sale_for/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}

This game has players flying a spaceship designed to look like it\u2019s build out of Lego bricks, and fighting other spaceships with a similarly brick-like design.\n\nThe game\u2019s visuals use a combination of 3D models for ships, simple geometric shapes for projectiles, and 2D painted backgrounds. This works, but each of these elements is pretty unimpressive - the ships are flat, untextured, and not lit in any sort of impressive way; the backgrounds are repetitive and uninspired, and projectiles glow in a way that can make it difficult to see your way between them when the battle gets particularly heated. Nothing that\u2019s a deal-breaker, but nothing great either.\n\nOn the gameplay side of things, this is just a solid, well-made Bullet Hell Shmup. There\u2019s a decent selection of upgradeable weapons you can pick up, with each one becoming up to two levels stronger after picking up stars enemies drop, with a third temporary super-powered form after that. The controls work well enough and it\u2019s fun to move around, and there\u2019s a decent enough variety of enemies. The game doesn\u2019t do anything truly revolutionary with the genre, but it\u2019s a fun entry in the genre nonetheless.\n\nHaving said that, this game is deceptively hard. Your ship has only three hits and that\u2019s it. Players can continue the last level they lost on\u2026 but with only one hit left. This means that Grand Brix Shooter isn\u2019t a particularly good choice for new players to the genre. Also, I should note that this game has a terrible, long-winded story about a robot abducting a child to fight for them (perhaps inspired by The Last Starfighter). Suffice it to say, this story is completely disposable.\n\nStill, while it\u2019s not without its flaws, and it doesn\u2019t do anything groundbreaking, players looking for a solid Shmup should find Grand Brix Shooter to be surprisingly entertaining, especially for a game that regularly goes on sale for $2. If you\u2019re a fan os Shmups, take my advice and give the game a try the next time it goes on sale.\n\n**tl;dr \u2013 Grand Brix Shooter is a Bullet Hell Shmup where players fight with spaceships designed to look like they\u2019re built out of Lego bricks. This is a solid entry in the genre, albeit a deceptively tough one. And while it doesn\u2019t do anything super-inventive or revolutionary, fans of the genre should find it to be well worth a look.**\n\n#Grade: **B**\n\n&gt; ^^You ^^can ^^now ^^support ^^this ^^subreddit ^^on ^^Patreon! ^^Please ^^click ^[HERE](https://www.patreon.com/eshopperreviews) ^^to ^^become ^^a ^^Sponsor!\n\n&gt; ^^This ^^month\u2019s ^^sponsors ^^are ^^Andy ^^Miller, ^^Exlene, ^^Johannes, ^^u/RamboFox, ^^Ilya ^^Zverev, ^^Connor ^^Armstrong, ^^Eli ^^Goodman, ^^K.H. ^^Kristoffer ^^Wulff,  ^^and ^^Stov. ^^Thank ^^you ^^for ^^helping ^^to ^^keep ^^the ^^reviews ^^coming!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "eShopperReviews", "subreddit_id": "t5_1ad7ys", "subreddit_subscribers": 7898, "subreddit_type": "restricted", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Grand Brix Shooter for Nintendo Switch - Review", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/eShopperReviews/comments/t8r7px/grand_brix_shooter_for_nintendo_switch_review/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}

These games don't go on sale very often. So I really just want $10 so I can get Mario Kart 8 on switch while its still on sale. (the sale ends on march 13th, leaving 7 days).\n\nSo what is Mario Kart 8 anyways? Mario Kart 8 is the best-selling switch game EVER! It is a racing game that revolves around using powerups to hit other classic mario characters in weird, twisty, cool mario courses. There is 4-player co-op AND online play too! (I have a switch online membership) The game is soon getting a DLC so that you can play a BUNCH of older mario levels that are remastered into mario kart 8, which I can't get if I don't have the game. I have been saving up for this game for forever, and this is my one chance to finally get it.\n\nWhy do I want it? I've always had a wii, and mario kart wii was me and my friends favorite game. The multiplayer was really good, and it was just a fun game in general. It was the only racing game I ever really clicked with, as I'm not really into that realistic car stuff. All the power-ups were so fun/rage inducing, and I liked how a player could go from 1st to like 7th in the matter of 5 seconds. I really want to experience that kind of game again, and mario kart 8 happens to be on sale right now, and official Nintendo games don't go on sale all that often, so now seems like the perfect chance, but I'm just $10 short.\n\nSW-2636-4341-2716\n\nThank you!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "GiftofGames", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tb4r", "subreddit_subscribers": 133316, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "[Request] [Switch] $10 Eshop gift card so I can get Mario Kart 8 on switch during the MAR10 day sale.", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/t7z4ji/request_switch_10_eshop_gift_card_so_i_can_get/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}

I'm interested to hear what other people want out of the next console as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI suspect the next console might release sometime early 2025, and I hope performance wise it can be comparable to base model ps4, but I still think that is unlikely.   \nConsidering the success of the switch, it's almost certain it'll be a switch 2, but I can't imagine what gimmick they'll throw in to differentiate it.\n\nI'd be very dissapointed if it does not at least have backwards compatibility and eshop purchases carry over. They definitely should carry over NSO and expansion titles. I can't imagine waiting for the dribble feed of slowly releasing nes, then snes etc for the nth time. By then gamecube can be considered retro, so are they going to come??\n\nI know for the switch OS the aim was to be minimalist and fast, but it'd be great if they could re-introduce themes, classic wii/wii-u like menu music, and folders. Since a lot of nintendo's audience has matured, I really hope they consider re-introducing miiverse like system, even if it's locked behind minimum age or some small fee.  \nThe switch's current os is very souless and lacks a lot of character. The fact that the eshop is super slow and is quiet doesn't help either.\n\nI hope they find a way to blend old switch and new switch eshop formats in a way that gives better organisation and categorisation. Currently, it's hard to find any games that aren't just recent best-sellers or on sale.

While I didn't like the old version, at least it was useable. Now even if a game says it's on sale, when you click on it, it will show the game is full price and not really on sale. Not to mention now it takes a crazy amount of RAM and CPU power to browse anything more than 3 pages, and takes really long to load the titles while scrolling down for more titles.\n\nThese are the few games that are on sale, and do show up as on sale on the actual page. It looks like this is how it will stay from now on, so I'll do what I can, but don't expect much.\n\nGame | Price/Link | Tags\n---|---|---|---\n**Monster Sanctuary** | [**$6.79 ~~$19.99~~**](https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/monster-sanctuary-switch/) | **Turn-based**/Fantasy setting/Monster Collector/Metroidvania/Pixel Graphics\n**Regalia: Of Men and Monarchs -

I only wish it was longer, it's not short by any means, but it's not long either. I would say depending on if you're trying to \"catch them all\" and explore everything and fight all bosses, this could easily be a 30+ hours game, but if you focus on the story, then it's about 20 to 30 hours.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I am not complaining that it's short, but that I was having so much fun, that I wish it didn't end.\n\n---\n#[Valkyria Chronicles]\n\nThis one is really hard to explain through words alone, but just in case, the VC series is a World War 2 military setting story, where you act as the lead of a squad and take mission to drive back the enemy. The story is drama heavy and the gameplay is tactical turn-based, but it's mixed with real-time third person shooter. \n\nYou can also make your own army by recruiting different types of solders, training them and upgrading their gear. From rifles to tanks, this is a game you have to experience to understand. \n\n---\n#[Tales series]\n\nYou can't go wrong with a Tales title, no matter which game you choose, this is a solid series if you want action combat, an anime adventure story, with lots of party banter, side-quests, and post-game content.\n\nBeautiful graphics and art work, combined with a great OST, makes for a really fun adventure, so don't miss out on it if you can get the game.\n\n---\n#[Ni no Kuni]\n\nIf you're looking for that great **Isekai fantasy adventure feel**, then these two games are where it's at. Fantastic visuals and great music, coupled with a great art style, a combo that is perfect for a chill and relaxed gaming experience. Especially when talking about the first game, with the help of **Studio Ghibli**, they managed to make a truly whimsical world with that Studio Ghibli classic touch. \n\n#####- Note: The games aren't connected story-wise, so you can start with any of them -\n\n#[Ni no Kuni\u2122 II: Revenant Kingdom] \n\nThis one focuses more on gameplay, with a Kingdom builder, Army battles, Heavy loot focus, and even character collector, this is the one to go with if you want more game than story. Still has the great music and he fantastical art style and setting. Add to that a lot of side activities like beating rare monsters, collecting cute creatures to help you in battle, and even going around the world to gather people to help you build your kingdom. You'll never be short on things to do.\n\nFinally, both of them have beautifully draw world that is just a pleasure to walkthrough, made even better with the amazing orchestral soundtrack.\n\n---\n#[Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth: Complete Edition] \n\n2 full games in 1. If you're a fan of the series then this is a must play, it dives into the lore more than a lot of the previous games, and also has one of the biggest Digimon rosters till to day.\n\nEven if you're not into the Digimon series, if you're looking for your next fix of **Capture/Evolve/Fusion -&gt; Grind -&gt; Capture/Evolve/Fusion -&gt; Grind** while you listen to your favorite podcast/music, then no need to wait anymore, with hours upon hours you can easily spend just grinding and completing the game's various content from side-quests, rare monsters, arena, and even tamer team fights. The gameplay is simple, which is a great way to keep your brain off, yet it still has challenge battles now and then to make sure you're doing your job grinding and raising your Digimons.\n\n---\n#[Digimon World: Next World Order] \n\nAnother amazing game in the series, but this one focuses entirely on raising 2 Digimon partners, so you won't have to collect monster, but depending on how you raise your digimons, they will have different evolutions, and there is a really huge evolution tree to explore.\n\nThen you have the base building aspect, and NPC collection to fill your base, within an open world, and you have a content heavy game. You'll be spending hours collecting NPCs, exploring new areas, raising your digimons, doing side-quests, and building up your base for hours and hours. All of this and we didn't even touch the main story.  \n\nThis is amazing monster raising game that Pokemon fans want, but probably will never get.\n\n---\n#[Legend of Mana Remaster]\n\nA Fantastic game in everything except it's combat, which is average. Though with this remaster, you can even turn off combat any time you want. The remaster in itself is great, polishing up the visuals and adding a ENTIRE orchestral version for each track in the game, and this is a game with an amazing soundtrack by **Yoko Shimomura**. So now you can switch between the original OST and the new orchestral one at any time.\n\nThe game follows an open-world concept with lots of freedom and giving you the choice on where to place each city/kingdom/dungeon on the map, and depending on how you do it, you'll unlock better weapons, items, quests, and so on.\n\nIt's a great game that you need to experience to know how good it is.\n\n\n---\n\n#As always, please do add your own recommendations, and let me know if there is mistake or if something was missing, and have a nice day.", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "JRPG", "subreddit_id": "t5_2quw1", "subreddit_subscribers": 160411, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "[JRPGs on Sale - Weekly Breakdown] For March 5 - 2022 - PSN/Switch/Xbox/Steam", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/t7kl4m/jrpgs_on_sale_weekly_breakdown_for_march_5_2022/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}

I'll consider every offer, but if it's notably lower than what's listed please don't be offended if I decline.***\n- ***Sales are first-come, first-served. Potential buyers have 24 hours from time of post claiming a game to pay for it, otherwise it goes to the next buyer in line.***\n- ***I'm not interested in splitting up bundles or \"parting out\" any items, sorry.***\n- ***All (used) games are tested prior to being sent out. All sales are final. I'm happy to provide pictures/video of games running upon request.***\n- ***Shipping: I strongly prefer to ship within the US. The cost of US shipping is already included in the price. I'd only be willing to mail outside of the US if the buyer is okay with paying the associated costs of international shipping.***\n- ***Packaging: Games are shipped in boxes or padded mailers depending on size.

I do have a second PC with a 3090 but I doubt it will ever be connected to the TV. \n\nShitty Visio soundbar (M51AX-J6) Because it was better than nothing and available when I needed it.\n\nDetails:\n\nI am recently divorced and agreed to give my now ex-wife my old system. My plan now is to just start fresh in my new apartment.  The main goal of this post is to find a decent quality AV receiver to build the rest of my system around as my situation stabilizes.\n\nI bought the TV back in November and the soundbar a few days later because there were literally zero decent AV receivers for sale in my area. Unfortunately, I realized tonight that I don't have enough inputs on the TV to connect all the things I want to connect. Hence my quest for an AV receiver.\n\nNot looking at speakers at the moment as I don't yet know what my permanent living situation will be, and I don't want to buy twice.\n\nUses:\n\nPrimary use will be gaming on one of the systems listed. While I do watch the occasional movie/tv show and listen to music on a semi regular basis, I am not a huge audiophile. \n\nRequirements:\n\nAt least 6 HDMI in\n\nEARC since I am still stuck with the sound bar for now.\n\nWifi/bluetooth would be nice but not essential as I can easily run a network cable to it.\n\nHDMI 2.1 bug fixed/not present.\n\nNot sure what else to look for here. I've read a ton but have been out of the home theater game for too long and there is a ton of info out there that I am still trying to wrap my head around.\n\nI'm happy to supply pics if they are necessary but, without speakers, I couldn't think of a reason they would be relevant.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "hometheater", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rof6", "subreddit_subscribers": 632675, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Receiver recommendation is needed.

It has never been docked. Purchased so my boyfriend and I could play the Pokemon games at the same time, but we found that we really only need one switch in the house. Comes in the box with everything included with a new switch. Everything is wrapped in the original plastic and in the box. The Pokemon Diamond and Pearl Double Pack includes the games, the box, the pre order bonus pins (from pre-ordering at GameStop), and the code for 200 Pokeballs. The pins are still in the sealed pack and have never been taken out. Asking **$450 for the bundle**. Would consider splitting the switch from the games &amp; pins if there's interest. \n\n**XBOX Game Pas Ultimate 3 Months, $35**\n\n* Xbox game pass- 3 months ultimate. I think it would be easiest to send the actual card in the mail so we can use PayPal G&amp;S and I can provide a tracking number.

Ah well, you win some, you lose some.\n\nAll told, my games reviewed to games owned ratio is now 1813/2580\n\nNow that I'm making it a point to track the number of subscribers, I'll also point out that this subreddit is at 7892 subscribers. That's not a huge growth from last month, but regardless I always appreciate seeing new faces here. To those of you new to the subreddit \u2013 welcome!\n\n.\n\n**Patreon Updates**\n\nOn the Patreon side of things, we had 12 patrons kindly donating in the month of February, and their contributions will be recognized in reviews throughout the month of February. If you\u2019re curious to see the names, you can check them out below (minus two who chose to remain anonymous).\n\nLast month, patrons voted for me to review Game Builder Garage, and you can find my review of that game [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/eShopperReviews/comments/smsad8/game_builder_garage_for_nintendo_switch_review/)\n\nPatrons who voted on a game for me to review *this* month voted for me to review Kirby and the Forgotten Land, and I will be reviewing the game as soon as I can get my hands on it.\n\n.\n\n**Monthly Patreon Vote - March**\n\nOnce again, any Patreon patron who donates $5 or more can have a say in which of the following games I review in March. This month, the games that will be up for the vote will be Advance Wars 1 + 2 Re-Boot Camp, Nintendo Switch Sports, Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee, and Nuclear Throne. I wanted this month to have a good mix of new and old, and of course if a new game gets chosen, I will review it as soon as I can.\n\n.\n\n**YouTube Channel Issues**\n\nAs I posted a few days back, YouTube decided to take down eShopperReviews' YouTube channel for reasons unknown, only to return it to normal later that same day. I still have no explanation what started all of this, but suffice it to say I have other options I can consider if this proves to be a particularly nasty problem in the future.\n\n.\n\n**Podcasts**\n\nAlso, as per usual, Patreon subscribers can hear me discussing the last month\u2019s highlights in a podcast we\u2019re making available to patrons first. If you\u2019re not a patron, you won\u2019t be completely left out - I\u2019ll have the podcast made available to everyone on YouTube in a week or so. However, if you\u2019re curious to hear the podcast right now, please consider heading over to the [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/eshopperreviews) and making a donation! In this month\u2019s podcast, we continue to experiment with the format, and among the things we discuss are the impending closing of the Wii U and 3DS eShops, the affect a game's topic matter has on its review, and motion control in videogames. And as per usual we discuss the last month\u2019s reviews that I deemed to be the best games, worst games, and hidden gems.\n\nAlso, after taking a month off to do the 2021 Game Awards, we returned to doing our usual Patron-exclusive Jenn Plays segments, this time featuring two games \u2013 Ice Climbers and Excitebike. And as much as Jenn's \u201chot takes\u201d often surprise me, this month she floored me with her opinion on both of these games. If you're curious to hear us talk about these games, discuss their history, and see what Jenn thinks of them, please consider becoming a Patreon patron!\n\n.\n\n**Live Streams**\n\nSome of you may have noticed, we're starting to do Live Streams of gameplay on Friday evenings at 7PM PST. We post the link here when the stream starts, and welcome anyone who wants to join in to please post questions or comments in the chat! In February, we live streamed [Pokemon Legends Arceus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go5gMGxDBWs), [Nintendo Switch Sports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVCYdScL5ic) ([Twice!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pA-fJn7Bjg), [Game Builder Games User-Created Content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ThgbjibFhc), and [Nintendo Switch's Less-Celebrated Greats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ThgbjibFhc).\n\n.\n\n**We Want Your Thoughts on Podcasts! And Live Streams too!**\n\nAs noted previously, we\u2019re considering making a more in-depth poll to get some feedback about our podcasts, but at least for now, I would very much appreciate your thoughts on the podcasts, regardless of whether you\u2019re a Patreon donor or not. Do you think we spend too much time talking about the news? Should we stop going over every game named here and focus only on a few highlights? What would you personally want us to change that would make you more interested in the podcasts? Please feel free to leave a comment below! Though\u2026 I make no promises about changes (I\u2019m just considering ideas right now).\n\nIn addition, now that we're doing live streams, we'd like to know your thoughts on those as well!\n\n.\n\n**Nintendo 3DS and Wii U Game Reviews**\n\nPerhaps it's a bit late, but with the eShops for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U closing, I felt like I should go back and review games for these platforms that have yet to find their way to Nintendo Switch, including Virtual Console games for these platforms. I will continue to add to these pages throughout the next year, trying to cover as many major releases as I can before these shops are closed for good. You can find my Nintendo 3DS reviews [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/eShopperReviews/wiki/3dsreviews_grade) ([here for alphabetical listing](https://old.reddit.com/r/eShopperReviews/wiki/3dsreviews_apha)), my Wii U reviews [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/eShopperReviews/wiki/wiiureviews_grade) ([here for alphabetical listing](https://old.reddit.com/r/eShopperReviews/wiki/wiiureviews_apha))), and the Virtual Console reviews for these platforms [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/eShopperReviews/wiki/3ds-wiiu-virtualconsole).\n\n.\n\n**eShopperReviews Subreddit Updates**\n\nOn the subreddit side of things, we has two \u201ctheme weeks\u201d in a row this month \u2013 Game Builder Games Week and Love, Lust, Dating, and Relationships Week, reviewing multiple games that fit within those themes.\n\nNo Game Industry Bad Behavior Profiles this month again \u2013 I was still far too busy with other things! Don't worry, I'll be getting back to it sooner or later...\n\nFor Wiki updates, I added pages for User-Created Content Reviews and Game Design Apps on Nintendo Switch: A Guide, as well as pages for all the new Wii U and 3DS reviews I'm writing (whose links you can find in the section above).\n\nI also added a review for the [Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack February 2022 Release for Nintendo 64](https://old.reddit.com/r/eShopperReviews/comments/t177wx/nintendo_switch_online_expansion_pack_february/) (The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask), with its contents added to the [N64 App page](https://old.reddit.com/r/eShopperReviews/wiki/nintendoswitchonline-expansionpack-n64app). I also added reviews for [Nintendo Switch Online February 2022 Releases for Nintendo Entertainment System and Super Nintendo Entertainment System](https://old.reddit.com/r/eShopperReviews/comments/sp9lbs/nintendo_switch_online_february_2022_releases_for/).\n\nOkay, I think that's it for major events on eShopperReviews in February, now onto some review highlights! Here's my picks for the most noteworthy games I reviewed in February 2022. As always, these are not necessarily games that came out this February, just what I was able to review this last month:\n\n.\n\n#The Best\n\n[Pokemon Legends Arceus](https://old.reddit.com/r/eShopperReviews/comments/sh3leq/pokemon_legends_arceus_for_nintendo_switch_review/) - This is not the \u201cBreath of the Wild of Pokemon games\u201d that many hoped it would be, and it's loaded with issues. However, despite these problems, this is the most fun I've had with a mainline Pokemon game in I don't know how long. The feeling of freedom as you explore the habitat of these creatures is wonderful, and I can only hope that the newly-announced Pokemon Scarlet and Violet takes more than a few pages out of Arceus's playbook.\n\n[Longstory: A Dating Game for the Real World](https://old.reddit.com/r/eShopperReviews/comments/suropb/longstory_a_dating_game_for_the_real_world_for/) - This may very well be my favorite romance story on Nintendo Switch. This Western Visual Novel has exceptionally well-written characters (although they're teenagers, so they are at times irrational), and is surprisingly inclusive, even by modern standards. If you're looking for a romance-focused story-driven game, you should absolutely give this one a look.\n\n[The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD](https://old.reddit.com/r/eShopperReviews/comments/t17bkj/the_legend_of_zelda_skyward_sword_hd_for_nintendo/) - This is still probably the worst 3D Zelda game, but that still puts this ahead of most other games in the genre. It certainly helps that this release fixes some of the biggest issues of the original Wii release of the game, adding tons of quality-of-life improvements, greatly improving the graphics, and giving multiple control options to help players find the best way to work with (or around) the game's odd motion control setup. If you're a Zelda fan, this is a must-play, although don't expect to be blown away with Breath of the Wild-like revolutionary gameplay.\n\n.\n\n#The Worst\n\n[Secrets of Me](https://old.reddit.com/r/eShopperReviews/comments/sty649/secrets_of_me_for_nintendo_switch_review/) -  I hated this game with a burning passion. This Visual Novel about a girl who gets plastic surgery to please her cheating fiance and subsequently gets sexually assaulted by every single guy who crosses paths with her has nasty messages about self-image, male entitlement, trust in relationships, and stalking, but even if you're \u201cinto that\u201d, you'll still be turned off by this game's terrible writing and atrocious localization. Trust me, you're a happier person not having played this game, don't ruin that.\n\n[Miners Races](https://old.reddit.com/r/eShopperReviews/comments/syqjyi/miners_races_for_nintendo_switch_review/) - Miners Races has a good concept \u2013 competitive Boulder Dash. However, it does absolutely nothing with that concept, creating a game that's as shallow as a puddle, and one you'll get bored of almost immediately. Skip it.\n\n[Angel's Punishment](LINK) \u2013 Angel's Punishment is a painfully mediocre Metroidvania that's priced at the absurd dollar amount of $25. Even when this game inevitably goes on sale for $2, I'm not sure you're getting your money's worth. Stick with actual *good* entries in the genre, there are tons on Nintendo Switch.\n\n.\n\n#Hidden Gems\n\n[Butcher](https://old.reddit.com/r/eShopperReviews/comments/sir15b/butcher_for_nintendo_switch_review/) - This is what Doom would play like if it was an Action-Platformer. It has the same sort of presentation, the same great fast-paced gameplay, and is just an absolute blast. If you're a fan of Action-packed Platformers, you should definitely get this game.\n\n[Gunvolt Chronicles: Luminous Avenger iX 2](https://old.reddit.com/r/eShopperReviews/comments/sir10h/gunvolt_chronicles_luminous_avenger_ix_2_for/) - This game follows in the footsteps of the first game, which was also an excellent Action-Platformer that played like a descendant of Mega Man X with a greater focus on melee combat. Another game you need to play if you're a fan of the genre.\n\n[SmileBasic 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/eShopperReviews/comments/sp9l4n/smilebasic_4_for_nintendo_switch_review/) - I did not give this release a grade when I reviewed it, because I'm just not qualified to review an actual programming language, which is what this is. However, I still wanted to draw attention to it here because out of all of the \u201cGame Builder\u201d apps I tried out in February, SmileBasic 4 had the most user-created games I would absolutely return to. Wonderful games like SpeedRungeon and Cyburst are so good that they could easily be released as-is on the eShop and they'd be worth buying. All together, I'd say there's an argument to be made that the $25 price tag of SmileBasic 4 may be worth it just to play these user-created games. If you're curious to read more about this, check out my reviews of these user-created games [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/eShopperReviews/wiki/user-created), or watch the stream where I play a selection of them [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVCYdScL5ic).\n\n.\n\nAnyway, that covers pretty much all of the big stuff for February. I hope you've all enjoyed reading what I have to say, and here's looking forward to next year!\n\n&gt; ^^You ^^can ^^now ^^support ^^this ^^subreddit ^^on ^^Patreon! ^^Please ^^click ^[HERE](https://www.patreon.com/eshopperreviews) ^^to ^^become ^^a ^^Sponsor!\n\n&gt; ^^This ^^month\u2019s ^^sponsors ^^are ^^Andy ^^Miller, ^^Exlene, ^^Johannes, ^^u/RamboFox, ^^Ilya ^^Zverev, ^^Connor ^^Armstrong, ^^Eli ^^Goodman, ^^K.H. ^^Kristoffer ^^Wulff,  ^^and ^^Stov. ^^Thank ^^you ^^for ^^helping ^^to ^^keep ^^the ^^reviews ^^coming!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "eShopperReviews", "subreddit_id": "t5_1ad7ys", "subreddit_subscribers": 7892, "subreddit_type": "restricted", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "eShopperReviews February 2022 Wrap-Up", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/eShopperReviews/comments/t4aqut/eshopperreviews_february_2022_wrapup/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}

This is backed by a subdued piano theme that is similarly extremely repetitive.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it\u2019s clear that this game\u2019s creator was inspired by Castlevania games like Symphony of the Night, but this game fails to get anywhere even remotely close to that level of quality. The pacing is frustratingly slow, the repetitive nature of the castle makes it easy to get lost, you see the same half-dozen creatures repeated ad nauseum, new abilities are handed out far too slowly and are not very inspired or original, your abilities require excessive grinding to power up, hit detection is bad\u2026 there is a *lot* that this game gets wrong.\n\nThe thing is, I can see a glimmer of potential in this game to be a bargain-bin Metroidvania\u2026 but even this potential is sullied by the game\u2019s absolutely ludicrous $25 price tag. It\u2019s clear what\u2019s going on here though - the creator is banking on the game going on sale for $2 to tout the massive 92% discount this represents\u2026 and even beyond how sleazy this is, it\u2019s dubious that this game is even worth the $2. However, that $25 price tag? That\u2019s so absurd one wonders just what universe anyone would see this as worthwhile, especially now that the phenomenal Castlevania Advance Collection has been released on the Nintendo Switch at a mere $20.\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled into thinking you\u2019re getting a good deal on this low-rent Metroidvania if you see it on sale. Angel\u2019s Punishment is a game absolutely loaded with problems, and this game should have been priced at $2 to begin with. Even then, it\u2019d be a tough sell on a platform that has so many truly great Metroidvanias.\n\n**tl;dr \u2013 Angel\u2019s Punishment is a Metroidvania that\u2019s clearly trying to imitate Castlevania, but it falls far short of this due to a wide range of problems like terrible pacing, poor hit detection, and extremely repetitive visuals and gameplay. On top of this, the game is using absurd pricing to try to game the Nintendo Switch eShop. Don\u2019t be fooled into thinking you\u2019re getting a deal by buying this Metroidvania - you\u2019re far better off spending a bit more and getting a game that\u2019s actually *good*.**\n\n#Grade: **D+**\n\n&gt; ^^You ^^can ^^now ^^support ^^this ^^subreddit ^^on ^^Patreon! ^^Please ^^click ^[HERE](https://www.patreon.com/eshopperreviews) ^^to ^^become ^^a ^^Sponsor!\n\n&gt; ^^This ^^month\u2019s ^^sponsors ^^are ^^MB, ^^Andy ^^Miller, ^^Johannes, ^^u/RamboFox, ^^Exlene, ^^Eli ^^Goodman, ^^Ilya ^^Zverev, ^^Stov, ^^Connor ^^Armstrong, ^^and ^^K.H. ^^Thank ^^you ^^for ^^helping ^^to ^^keep ^^the ^^reviews ^^coming!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "eShopperReviews", "subreddit_id": "t5_1ad7ys", "subreddit_subscribers": 7891, "subreddit_type": "restricted", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Angel\u2019s Punishment for Nintendo Switch - Review", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/eShopperReviews/comments/t3hspp/angels_punishment_for_nintendo_switch_review/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}

But I've spent money on three games this month and have added seven to the backlog in total (see Games I've Added for more info). My love for gaming is in full swing right now since I'm off from uni after having finished all my exams for a while. And adding to the backlog and having more games to play in the future isn't something I'm worried about anymore.\n\n# II: Games I've Quit | 2\n\n* **Cave Story+**\n* **Dear Esther**\n\nThe first game I've quit/abandoned this year is **Cave Story+**, a game that I didn't even get past the first level of. Didn't seem like my type of game from the start but with the controls being as horrendous as they were, I decided to not bother further after having downloaded it. It was an Epic freebie anyway, so it's fine.\n\nHaving played similar games to **Dear Esther** over the years, I quickly realized this wasn't going to be for me. To add to this I got lost early on and after that didn't have the interest to push through.\n\n\\----------\n\n# III: Games I\u2019ve Added | 7\n\n* **Bloodborne**\n* **Dark Souls III**\n* **Dear Esther**\n* **Dying Light**\n* **Peaky Blinders: Mastermind**\n* **Resident Evil 2**\n* **Shakedown Hawaii**\n\n**Bloodborne** wasn't a purchase but rather something I decided to simply check out via the PS Plus Collection. I'm not even a big fan of soulslikes usually, mainly because of the amount of time it takes to get back to a boss once you die, but Elden Ring got me unusually hyped. I'm not going to get Elden Ring however due to all the bugs and save issues being reported, so I'll wait for the first sale at least. Bloodborne seems more generous with the amount of blood vials it gives you compared to something like Dark Souls and it's made boss fights more manageable in the first few tries as a result whilst still keeping the tension insanely high for someone as incompetent as me in these games. Beat Gascoigne after three tries, will keep playing.\n\nI also added **Dark Souls III**, which has been in my brother's Steam library for about 5 years and I can play via Steam Family Sharing. I played 10 hours or so of Dark Souls I again the past few days and while it's been fun, I got cursed and now had to both find souls and the fitting character to get uncursed, which kind of took the fun away, especially since the PC port of that game really sucks in many ways. Since I had played it a lot back in the day anyway, I decided to try out Dark Souls III instead, which should have a bunch of QoL improvements and hopefully, fewer framerate issues.\n\nAs mentioned above, I've already given up on **Dear Esther**, which was given away for free on Steam this month, so I don't feel bad for abandoning it.\n\nAs you can tell, my return to gaming has been led by being hyped for the newest game releases. To be fair, Dying Light 2 I was looking forward to since its first ever announcement, whilst Elden Ring seems to potentially be a generational type game, so this is a unique situation. I bought **Dying Light** to play in coop with my brother. I would have bought the new one but the story, what got me hyped in the first place, seems to have been a 'fail', so I don't see paying full price for a similar game.\n\nMy brother got **Resident Evil 2** and I get access to it via Steam Family Sharing. Probably won't play this for a while myself, he's already done.\n\nI'm an extremely big fan of Peaky Blinders, and with the series soon to return for its final season, I thought I'd pass the time by grabbing **Peaky Blinders: Mastermind** for Switch on sale. Said I wouldn't buy much for money in the last post, broke that expectation already. But for it, I'm hoping it'll be worth it.\n\nI've added **Shakedown Hawaii** through the recent Humble Bundle, my first Bundle purchase since probably pre-pandemic. Had this game on my wishlist since it came out and I doubt I'll get the game this cheap any time soon. (In before EPIC give it away for free next week)\n\n\\----------\n\n# IV: Games I've Beaten | 4\n\nA quick overview of all the games I've beaten this month. Reviews are in alphabetical order. (**Bold** = Game of the Month)\n\n* Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood\n* **Ken Follett's The Pillars of the Earth**\n* Metro 2033\n* Rise of the Tomb Raider\n\n# Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood\n\n**Owned Since:** Unknown\n\n**Beaten**: February 16th, 2022\n\n**Platform**: PC\n\n**Playtime**: 12 hours\n\nIf AC: Brotherhood came out today, simply with updated graphics and better platforming, it would be deemed a poor game. The reason for why I think AC Brotherhood overall is a below average experience is, at least partly, the same for why I think Far Cry 4 is actually pretty good. **Time**.\n\nFar Cry 4 I had played back in 2016, one of the first single player games I ever played after playing FIFA almost exclusively until then. I loved the open world, the countless side activities, the tower climbing and the repetitive nature of it, plus Pagan Min was a great, yet underutilized villain, though that's besides the point. But play it today after playing 50 games that are the same and you'll come away less impressed and possibly burnt out. Or you will skip most side activities, push through the main story and potentially not see it as enough to have made the experience that worthwhile.\n\nAnd that's how I feel about AC: Brotherhood. Surely it would have been a classic in my eyes if I had played it back when it came out, like it is for so many others, but playing it today, I have to say the game did not age well in many aspects, similarly to its predecessor.\n\nWhat I can say is that the game either improved over AC 2 in many aspects, or pretty much remained the same.\n\nCombat, while still not great, was improved upon thanks to the kill-chain feature. Kill one enemy and all others can be killed with one strike. The crossbow lets you kill enemies from afar. You also recruit Assassins who you can call in and who stylishly take out a few enemies.\n\nThe only part that has aged better than the combat probably is the soundtrack of this game, which as with AC 2, is beautiful. Can't imagine how nostalgic it must be listening to it again 11 years later if you had played the game when it originally came out. The music in this game and in this trilogy especially is truly timeless.\n\nRome, where the game mainly takes place, looks good when you factor in that the game came out in 2010. Playing it today, it doesn't look jaw-dropping or anything from a graphical standpoint, but kudos to the development team for putting it together in less than a year after AC 2 released.\n\nAnd to give one final positive point, the story really picks up near the end of the seventh sequence. There are &gt;!9!&lt;. The ending was satisfying and made me interested in playing Revelations as well, though I'm sure to take another break from the series for a few months again.\n\nBut as you can tell, and let's start here with the negatives, saying the story picked up all the way in Sequence 7 is not great when the previous parts take close to 8 hours or so on their own, if you ignore side activities mostly.\n\nIn fact, sequences 2 to 4 only serve one purpose and that is giving justification to all the side activities around the map. You gotta help out those numerous generic courtesans, thiefs and do all these extra assassinations because your mom, Claudia, La Volpe etc. require it of you to aid your mission, even though not doing them at all will lead to the same result. If you really fell in love with the world and the gameplay, it's of course nice that the game offers a bunch of content, however generic, to allow you to spend more time with it, but the only side missions that were interesting to me and of which I did more than one were Da Vinci's missions. Most of the others were pretty much the same as in AC 2,  but Da Vinci's missions where you have to capture and destroy his war machines were pretty fun, and a naval mission is included as well.\n\nBut to justify all of this, the pacing of the story suffers, which did annoy me. And from sequence 5 to 7.5, nothing of importance really happened, you just &gt;!hop from target to target for a while!&lt;.\n\nWorst of all, the level design up until that point was really terrible. Tailing targets was part of every Sequence at least once, if not more and all you do is follow them for a few minutes, either on foot or on horseback. And the targets do this stupid thing where they just stop and fully turn around to check if they're being followed. I find this cringe inducing where ever it is included and it's no different here.\n\nOnce you tail your target for up to 10-15 minutes, though usually less than that, you fight a few enemies or climb a tall building and get rewarded with a few cut scenes. Thanks to the new combat features, fighting is enjoyable enough, so long as trees don't block your view, but platforming controls are again so clunky and I can't tell you how many times Ezio did something I never asked him to do. Or didn't do something I did ask him to do. For example standing on top of a wall and pressing circle so that he drops down. Only sometimes you press circle and move away from the wall as you do so, which for some reason triggers the animation where Ezio holds on to the ledge again. I didn't even move into the direction of the wall! But Ezio jumping off of a building instead of jumping up was definitely the most annoying part.\n\nSure you get used to it, by which I mean you will still see Ezio do the wrong thing and you simply accept it, but it happens too frequently considering you spent almost all of your time outside of missions platforming. When the platforming does click and you're on top of buildings jumping from one to the next it does sometimes feel pretty smooth and fun, so I wish climbing itself would have been better. Today's games are criticized for way smaller offenses in that regard but I guess I can partly see past it due to the game's age.\n\nI also had the game freeze on me twice because I was being attacked right when a cutscene triggered, which allowed me to watch the cutscene but not return to play after.\n\nOverall, the mostly mundane level design for large parts of the game was coupled with poor pacing and uninteresting story developments. Right when the story picked up in both pace and intrigue later on, a few additional gameplay elements were added to make the levels more interesting, but some of the core issues still remained that can be pretty much nailed down to the game not aging too well.\n\nAlso, while the story did pick up, none of the side characters I thought really were that interesting and there wasn't shown from the villains to make me really want to kick their ass apart from the prologue.\n\n**Rating**: 5.5/10\n\n# Ken Follett's The Pillars of the Earth\n\n**Owned Since:** March 5th, 2019\n\n**Beaten**: February 10th, 2022\n\n**Platform**: PC\n\n**Playtime**: 15 hours\n\nGoing into this game and playing through the Prologue and First Chapter, I was at first put off by the fact that a central theme to the game would be Christianity. I don't mind Religion itself, I just didn't think a story revolving around the Priory of Kingsbridge would be of interest to me.\n\nGladly, I've realized that the game would become much more, a game about power, conspiracy and politics and the consequences it has on mankind, causing them to suffer and either using their faith to deal with that or losing it as a result.\n\nWhat the game has really managed well, and the books I suppose since it's based on the books by Ken Follett, is to show a fair perspective on Christianity and Religion as a whole. There is good in Religion, such as giving people hope to keep on going despite all the punches life throws at you, and striving to appeal to the kindness in men towards their neighbors, whilst also presenting how it is used to trick people, how miracles are sold to common folk for ulterior motives of the men in charge, how the men said to be closest to God can be the one's going against what is preached in the worst kind of way.\n\nI also like how the Cathedral played a large role in portraying all of these emotions like hope, misery, faith, pain and the feelings evoked by both loss and gain.\n\nAll this tied together into an engaging plot, however the pacing in this game was not the best in my opinion. While I didn't find any chapter to be one too many, the chapters held within quite a lot of filler I felt to simply pad the length of a game. Some of the sections I felt could have rather been put into some 'codex' type stuff for the player to check out optionally if he wanted to. In addition, for a game that seemed to be so fascinated with doing very clean animations for what NPCs would be doing at a given time, including during dialogue, that if you selected a dialogue option, you would have to wait for the NPC to finish his animation before the dialogue commenced. And in turn, the characters lips didn't even match what was eventually said, moving long after the sentence was over with. Not to mention that there always was a few second delay between all lines just to compensate for a small animation that would make a character hunch forward instead of backward for example.\n\nSome characters I also didn't really like and didn't really buy the progression of, like Richard, the brother of Aliena, who turned from 12/13 year son of an Earl with no backbone to a loudmouth soldier 5 years later, with no real explanation on what had happened in that time to make him that confident all of a sudden, unless I missed it. I'm sure the book does a better job there though and others might feel differently about him. Bishop Waleron Bigod, one of the antagonists, also could have had his character explored a bit more I felt like, since many of his actions weren't really explained much, if at all, &gt;!until late into the game!&lt;. His character had a lot of untapped potential I felt like, again something I'm sure is done more thoroughly, while in the game priorities lied elsewhere, which I can't necessarily fault them for.\n\nMany of the characters however did have a big role to play in this story and their own stories work well with the themes that are explored in this game constantly. In general I think I might buy the books and read them, because give these characters all a few dozen to a hundred pages to shine individually without being held back by the limitations of a video game due to gameplay and budget, and it seems obvious why the book(s) have seen both an adaptation as a game and a movie.\n\nAnd I have to say I appreciated how short Book 3 ended up being (almost half as short as the other 2). It felt very focused and the pacing was perfect to deliver a satisfying ending to this tale.\n\nAs a final note, I have experienced many technical issues with a game of this type, which was surprising. The game \"froze\" on me six (6) times, meaning nothing happened after selecting a dialogue option, and there have been frequent, albeit very short, scratches when the music would change, plus sometimes the inventory screen where all documents and other items would be shown would shake uncontrollably, which might have been because my controller was connected, though not used. None of these were terrible issues, only the freezes would make me lose a few minutes of progress, though still odd for a game of this size.\n\n**Rating**: 7/10\n\n# Metro 2033\n\n**Owned Since:** June, 2016\n\n**Beaten**: February 24th, 2022\n\n**Platform**: PC\n\n**Playtime**: 9.5 hours\n\nIn this game, you play Artyom in a post apocalyptic world in Moscow. The few dozen thousand humans who remain live in Metro stations after a nuclear war devastated the world.\n\nThe story of this game is that your home is being threatened by \"The Dark Ones\", a strong type of mutants. There are a few other types that you meet in this game, like Nosalises (90% of the monsters you meet are these) and huge scorpions but you have to request help for your own settlement against this new large threat, for which you have to travel to Polis.\n\nYour character is young and hasn't really been outside of the \"comforts\" of his own home, and in journals you can find within each level Artyom notes down his thoughts, often describing how he is disgusted how much death and suffering he is seeing in such a short amount of time and how despite all these monsters, humans still keep on killing each other (apart from monsters, there are also human enemies).\n\nSo on your quest to find help and fight off the Dark Ones, you travel across the Metro and meet a few different characters who help you reach your destination. Two of these, Khan and Bourbon, have a lot of character despite the fact that they don't hang around for too long. Khan for example teaches you about the threat of \"anomalies\" and ghosts, while Bourbon seems to have a messy history with pretty much every group of people you stumble upon alongside him.\n\nThroughout all this, you get to see how people live in these Metro's, how they waste time and what they have to live with. It helped with the atmosphere of the game tremendously (which in general was great) but I also liked how the game didn't dwell on these parts for too long and mixed it in nicely with all of the action.\n\nCombat in this game can be of somewhat easy and very tough difficulty depending on your choice of how much resources you want access to. Years ago when I started this I wanted the \"true\" Metro experience where resources are very scarce. It doesn't help that bullets are a currency in this game as well. So when I mismanaged this and had a hard time very early on, I quit.\n\nNow I decided to hell with it and chose the \"more resources\" option, which still left me struggling for ammo here and there but never in a way that it hindered my progress.\n\nThe game is an FPS and you can add extensions to your typical pistols, rifles, shotguns etc. The sound design of the weapons I didn't find to be that great but I can't comment on its realism since I have no clue. One weapon I didn't like was the flamethrower. You get it and have to use it in close corridors, so you put yourself on fire multiple times during this level, which simply just sucked and weirdly, the flamethrower would NOT let me fire afterwards even though I had enough ammo.\n\nIn general, there were a lot of issues I had with gameplay, which didn't age that well overall. Not surprising since the game is 12 years old. For example in one level you use a mounted machine gun to shoot your enemies but you control up and down movement with your left stick and right/left movement with your right stick, which is not only stupid but also infuriating since it made me die more than a few times. On keyboard/mouse it's not different since you have to use both the mouse and the A+D buttons (or W+S, not sure).\n\nThere also is a level where there are monsters who do not attack as long as you look them right in the eyes. For some reason, they still attacked me, so I died many times as you can't kill them.\n\nIn other levels, it's not apparent what you should do and sometimes (almost) dying is part of a cutscene and sometimes it isn't, which was often confusing.\n\nAnd worst of all, in the level \"cursed\" I explored the small area whilst my companion talked to a few guys, or at least he was supposed to. See it didn't actually trigger because I wasn't near him and so I totally missed out on the mission objective, of which there were multiple. So I had to go to YouTube to see what to do, since the game auto saved during the mission and there is no multiple save points or \"restart the mission\" option, you can ONLY go to your \"last checkpoint\".\n\nIn general, the checkpoint system in this game, one of my biggest grievances with games, was a 2/5 and back in the day would have made me quit a few hours in and still would have this time had I used a harder difficulty setting probably.\n\nSo overall gameplay was below average while atmosphere was great and the story was solid. I think all of this can be built on a lot more in the next two games so I'm looking forward to playing those in the future. I own both.\n\n**Rating**: 7/10\n\n# Rise of the Tomb Raider\n\n**Owned Since:** March 5th, 2019\n\n**Beaten**: February 22nd, 2022\n\n**Platform**: PC\n\n**Playtime**: 14.5 hours\n\nThis is the most average game I've played in my life I think. It's had its good parts and its bad parts, resulting in a game that I had fun playing but will likely quickly forget about.\n\nAfter Tomb Raider (2013) introduced us to the new Lara, a game I finished all the way back in 2018, I was looking forward to playing the sequel and seeing how they develop her character further. The first focused on turning her from curious yet frightened girl to the Tomb Raider she shall eventually become and the slow build up was more than fine.\n\nUnfortunately, Rise of the Tomb Raider ended up being a lot of the same. Lara has a serious lack of character in my opinion and pretty much all of her dialogue in this game was \"I have to find the divine source to prove my father right\". No substance, no relationships built beyond this, nothing else we learn about Lara here either.\n\nJonah, her only friend it seems, was unfortunately &gt;!absent for almost all of the game!&lt; for some reason and all characters she meets that are friendly are incredibly forgettable. The story is in general, mostly because of the way it's told, partly because it's also not a great and especially not a unique story to tell.  If you're enjoying these games for the gameplay, it'll be fine enough.\n\nThere are a couple set pieces that were pretty awesome, like the &gt;!bombs being detonated on the glaciers and them falling down on top of you!&lt; or &gt;!walking up to Konstantin to finish him off while he talks about your father!&lt; (heavy spoiler!). There was also one twist regarding the Prophet that I enjoyed.\n\nBut I can already see myself having to read up the summary of the plot for this game in a couple years when playing Shadow of the Tomb Raider and thinking \"I don't remember any of this\", kinda similar to my reaction on reading Tomb Raider's summary, though a few moments did stay in my memory at least.\n\nThe worst offense though was the final boss fight, which was easily among the Top 3 worst final bosses I've ever played, just because how 1) uneventful and 2) buggy it was. For example, the boss would &gt;!shoot grenades at himself!&lt; accidentally, which didn't do anything or I could hit him a million times and he'd be stuck in a loop but because I wouldn't hit him like the game wanted me to, it wouldn't really do anything besides waste my time. And what the game wants you to do isn't really good.\n\nAnd throughout this game, Lara's single motivation doesn't change, until at the end, where the game basically tells us that \"I promise in the next game she'll become a badass\" with an actual own will. Well, let's see.\n\nThe gameplay loop itself was fun overall. You get a bow, a pistol, shotgun and rifles as weapons, plus you got like 10 tools to unlock to help you with traversal and opening up new tombs and other stuff to explore. The game has a few features to many I felt and more than once I found myself not really wanting to spend my skill points on anything because none of them seemed all that useful to me. I've played on the second hardest difficulty by the way, which was a bit too easy but overall fitting, though still didn't help me with deciding which skills would be more useful.\n\nWhat I really enjoyed in this game was Lara's voice acting. Especially in a game like this that played in the cold, the voice actress perfectly conveys how cold Lara really is, with her teeth chattering and her body shivering voiced extremely realistically.\n\nAnother thing is that the game has a few hubs that it brings you back to from time to time after finishing main story sequences. With the new tricks you learn, you unlock new areas that are placed in that same hub that were previously unreachable and you can immediately use those new tricks to hunt for those collectables that you also couldn't get to, which was pretty neat.\n\nApart from the main story, you got a couple hundred collectables to find, a bunch of animals to hunt to unlock upgrades to your gear, Far Cry style, side missions to do to help NPCs which unlocks useful stuff but aren't anything besides \"collect this x times, do this x times\" and, of course, raid tombs, which was pretty fun.\n\nWhen fighting enemies, I enjoyed stealth sections the most but close quarter encounters were pretty tough and fun as well. What I didn't like was pretty much the final hour of the game, where &gt;!you had encounter after encounter with the \"cursed\" enemies that were harder to kill!&lt;.\n\nOh and finally, for some reason I found the soundtrack and some of the sound design to not really be that good. Sometimes the music would like build up in an epic way as if a new boss was about to show up but I was simply collecting feathers and no enemy was in sight, which was weird and happened like as if it was part of a \"exploring\" track or something. Odd.\n\nSo all in all, quite an average experience. Nice time killer, nothing more, nothing less.\n\n**Rating**: 6/10\n\n\\-----------------\n\nV: Currently Playing\n\n**PC**\n\n* **Mad Max**: Six hours in and I think I can join the \"Mad Max is underrated\" gang. On a surface level, this is yet another open world checklist kind of game with the Mad Max theme slapped on top. And yes, you have to at least be fine with these types of games, otherwise Mad Max indeed isn't for you. Among these open world \"lookalikes\", Mad Max stands out though thanks to clearly being inspired by the original movies in how detailed the lore is in the game itself. They've managed to fill out and apocalyptic setting nicely with realistic encounters, there is tons of stuff to upgrade and customize, survival mechanics are there but not too intrusive, rather actually incentivize exploring because of supply scarcity (especially ammo) and so far, the story is more than serviceable. Likely the next long game I'll try to beat before uni starts in late March.\n* **It Takes Two**: Didn't play it in February any further, hopefully will pick it back up in March\n* **Dark Souls III**: As mentioned, I've played Dark Souls I again since I wanted an Elden Ring type game to play (Bloodborne is slightly different), and the 10 hours I've played where fun, up until the point where I got cursed, lost half of my HP and need to grind for a while just to get it back. I've read that these enemies that curse you are hated by many, and I can see why. Post-death stat effects suck in any game since it ruins my desire to explore and rather has me forcefully focused on getting the effect lifted for however long it will take. I've had no problem dying dozens of times to all kinds of stuff because it's part of the \"git gud\" experience but THIS, this is just the \"time wasting\" experience in my book. Dark Souls 3 does let you get cursed as well but has no lasting penalty, and all the other QoL improvements makes me hopeful this will be the first Soulsborne game I actually complete\n\n**Playstation 5**\n\n* **Bloodborne**: Died very far away from my last checkpoint on the search for the next one and the next boss. It's fun but the itch says I want more Souls than Borne right now, so we'll see how much I play this in March.\n* **Persona 5**: 25 hours in, a GUARANTEED completion this year after having played it for the past 5 and restarting it 3 times, the most recent try 70 hours in. It's fun, so I don't complain about restarting, I just got to stick with IT and Gaming for a long enough time to beat it without getting lost due to the fact that I abandon it for a year.\n\n**Xbox One**\n\n**Nintendo Switch**\n\n\\------------------\n\n# VI: 12in12 original list | 6/12 completed\n\n* **Batman: Arkham Origins | COMPLETED in January**\n* **Mass Effect 2 | COMPLETED in January**\n* **Rise of the Tomb Raider | COMPLETED in February**\n* **Assassins Creed Brotherhood | COMPLETED in February**\n* Layers of Fear 2\n* **Disco Elysium | COMPLETED in January**\n* F.E.A.R (replacing Halo 4)\n* Uncharted 4: A Thief's End\n* Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus\n* **Ken Follett's The Pillars of the Earth | COMPLETED in February**\n* Horizon Zero Dawn\n* Anachronox\n\nAnother great month for this list, over halfway through. Never actually beat all 12 in this list in a given year, most I got was 11, so let's hope this year is the one. I replaced Halo 4 with F.E.A.R since I realized I don't really want to play Halo 4 that badly, not to mention that it's not really in my backlog, rather would have been a Game Pass playthrough. Instead I added F.E.A.R to join Layers of Fear 2 for my October games.\n\n\\------------------\n\nVII: My Stats\n\n* **Games Added**: 7\n* **Total Price**: 11 \u20ac\n* **Games Removed**: 2\n* **Games Finished**: 4\n* **Games Left in the Backlog**: 96\n\nA long ass post, a fun gaming month. Unfortunately many things besides gaming were not (private stuff, ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Yemen), which might explain why I've played games more than usual, which I appreciate for offering me distraction whenever I'm feeling down. \n\nHope you enjoyed reading my post.

I buy pretty much all one cent games, even if they are bad, since I get it back in gold points anyway. Pretty much with anything by Drageus Games, you\u2019re better off playing a free flash game.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s definitely been good games I\u2019ve purchased this way too. I wouldn\u2019t have purchased a game like Saints Row IV for the full $40, but it went on sale for like $3 or so a couple weeks back, and I definitely got my money\u2019s worth. Actually with gold points, I basically got the game free. I tend to avoid rated M game; they can be very hit or miss for me. I\u2019d probably not buy a game like that had it been $15 or something. But like, the sale was so ridiculous I\u2019d be stupid not to spend my points on it.\n\nI also bought Monster Hunter Rise at Walmart on Black Friday because I was surprised to see it for more than half off during its release year. It was $25. In the end though, I don\u2019t know if it was that good for me, since I have a long history of giving up on Monster Hunter\u2019s difficultly. Haven\u2019t played for a while.\n\nOther games I\u2019ve waited for a sale. LEGO games go on sale so often, there is no reason to buy them at full price. (The new Star Wars one might be an exception.) Just today I bought Hollow Knight, which is currently on sale. Based on how the content is described, the game is probably worth the $15. But I waited for the sale anyway because I knew it went on sale before. I also waited two years to buy Super Mario Odyssey because I missed a previous Black Friday deal.\n\nMost of the games I bought at full price are games I get a ton of hours in anyway.

As we all now know, the Switch port is straight dookie. \n\nI stuck with it because I didn\u2019t mind the problems, also I couldn\u2019t get a refund for it (Thanks Nintendo), but the problems were there it just didn\u2019t bother me as much. Fast forward to today and I\u2019m playing the same trilogy on the PS4 and the my god, this game was never meant to be played on Switch. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, the game isn\u2019t perfect and the problems are still there, but the differences of the PS4 and Switch ports are INSANE. It\u2019s like I\u2019m playing it for the first time. So much smoother and it just looks ten times better. Hopefully with the new updates that are supposedly coming , the games will get better.

While I didn't like the old version, at least it was useable. Now even if a game says it's on sale, when you click on it, it will show the game is full price and not really on sale. Not to mention now it takes a crazy amount of RAM and CPU power to browse anything more than 3 pages, and takes really long to load the titles while scrolling down for more titles.\n\nThese are the few games that are on sale, and do show up as on sale on the actual page.\n\nGame | Price/Link | Tags\n---|---|---|---\n**Monster Sanctuary** | [**$6.79

and balanced to make sure you are having fun collecting new monsters and customizing your team through evolution/skill trees/gear and making the best in-sync party you can. I only wish it was longer, it's not short by any means, but it's not long either. I would say depending on if you're trying to \"catch them all\" and explore everything and fight all bosses, this could easily be a 30+ hours game, but if you focus on the story, then it's about 20 to 30 hours.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I am not complaining that it's short, but that I was having so much fun, that I wish it didn't end.\n\n---\n#[Valkyria Chronicles]\n\nThis one is really hard to explain through words alone, but just in case, the VC series is a World War 2 military setting story, where you act as the lead of a squad and take mission to drive back the enemy. The story is drama heavy and the gameplay is tactical turn-based, but it's mixed with real-time third person shooter. \n\nYou can also make your own army by recruiting different types of solders, training them and upgrading their gear. From rifles to tanks, this is a game you have to experience to understand. \n\n---\n#[Tales series]\n\nYou can't go wrong with a Tales title, no matter which game you choose, this is a solid series if you want action combat, an anime adventure story, with lots of party banter, side-quests, and post-game content.\n\nBeautiful graphics and art work, combined with a great OST, makes for a really fun adventure, so don't miss out on it if you can get the game.\n\n---\n#[Battle Chasers: Nightwar] \n\nAn actual kickstarter JRPG that more than delivered what it set it out for and then more. It went under the radar since release, but it's a great turn-based JRPG with great characters and challenging combat. Then add to that:\n\n* A satisfying crafting system.\n* Arena fights.\n* Fishing.\n* Deep and interesting Skill trees.\n* A fantastic in-game encyclopedia with an actual incentive to complete and gameplay rewards.\n* A great tiered loot system.\n* Dungeons with random events, traps, and side-quests every time you enter.\n\nAnd last but not least, really great monsters to battle and rare ones to hunt. It's more than worth full price, but right now it's dirt cheap.\n\n---\n#[Ys series]\n\nThis is a case of a whole series is filled with great games, it's really hard to go wrong here. \n\nBut if you're going to choose one, then this one is an easy pick. Fantastic soundtrack ? check! Great Smooth Action gameplay ? check! Dogi the wall breaker ? check! Base building and crafting ? check! and check! So if you're looking amazing music while you hack and slash your way through monsters and bosses, then **Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of DANA** is easily your go to game.\n\n---\n#[Ni no Kuni\u2122 II: Revenant Kingdom] \n\nThis one focuses more on gameplay, with a Kingdom builder, Army battles, Heavy loot focus, and even character collector, this is the one to go with if you want more game than story. Still has the great music and he fantastical art style and setting. Add to that a lot of side activities like beating rare monsters, collecting cute creatures to help you in battle, and even going around the world to gather people to help you build your kingdom. You'll never be short on things to do.\n\nFinally, both of them have beautifully draw world that is just a pleasure to walkthrough, made even better with the amazing orchestral soundtrack.\n\n---\n#[Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth: Complete Edition] \n\n2 full games in 1. If you're a fan of the series then this is a must play, it dives into the lore more than a lot of the previous games, and also has one of the biggest Digimon rosters till to day.\n\nEven if you're not into the Digimon series, if you're looking for your next fix of **Capture/Evolve/Fusion -&gt; Grind -&gt; Capture/Evolve/Fusion -&gt; Grind** while you listen to your favorite podcast/music, then no need to wait anymore, with hours upon hours you can easily spend just grinding and completing the game's various content from side-quests, rare monsters, arena, and even tamer team fights. The gameplay is simple, which is a great way to keep your brain off, yet it still has challenge battles now and then to make sure you're doing your job grinding and raising your Digimons.\n\n---\n#[Digimon World: Next World Order] \n\nAnother amazing game in the series, but this one focuses entirely on raising 2 Digimon partners, so you won't have to collect monster, but depending on how you raise your digimons, they will have different evolutions, and there is a really huge evolution tree to explore.\n\nThen you have the base building aspect, and NPC collection to fill your base, within an open world, and you have a content heavy game. You'll be spending hours collecting NPCs, exploring new areas, raising your digimons, doing side-quests, and building up your base for hours and hours. All of this and we didn't even touch the main story.  \n\nThis is amazing monster raising game that Pokemon fans want, but probably will never get.\n\n---\n#[Yakuza: Like a Dragon] \n\nCritically acclaimed and at the top of most lists for 2020 and winner of so man awards, this is easily a big turning point for the Yakuza series.\n\nDon't miss out on the game that literally made them change the combat for the future games, from action to turn-based, with it's Main Character (Ichiban Kasuga) winning the number 1 spot for the best character for 2020. The Yakuza series was already crazy fun, and now it's Turn-based. I think the steam score and more than 8K reviews on steam are more than enough to show how good the game is.\n\n---\n#[Legend of Mana Remaster]\n\nA Fantastic game in everything except it's combat, which is average. Though with this remaster, you can even turn off combat any time you want. The remaster in itself is great, polishing up the visuals and adding a ENTIRE orchestral version for each track in the game, and this is a game with an amazing soundtrack by **Yoko Shimomura**. So now you can switch between the original OST and the new orchestral one at any time.\n\nThe game follows an open-world concept with lots of freedom and giving you the choice on where to place each city/kingdom/dungeon on the map, and depending on how you do it, you'll unlock better weapons, items, quests, and so on.\n\nIt's a great game that you need to experience to know how good it is.\n\n\n---\n\n#As always, please do add your own recommendations, and let me know if there is mistake or if something was missing, and have a nice day.", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "JRPG", "subreddit_id": "t5_2quw1", "subreddit_subscribers": 159840, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "[JRPGs on Sale - Weekly Breakdown] For February 24 - 2022 - PSN/Switch/Xbox/Steam", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/t0i0qe/jrpgs_on_sale_weekly_breakdown_for_february_24/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}
