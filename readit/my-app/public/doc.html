<p>Tonight, as gearshift has said, the fights got to be done right now. If we don't stand still on Republic right now that it will fall in this republic falls, a blade of liberty of a graph. Rather, I believe it's our last chance. So I encourage all of you to take a personal responsibility for doing what was already done. Because not just voting is not enough. Certainly, you should vote for someone like ours and Paul, who will keep us up. But we also should understand that the USS Titanic is sinking, it's already struck the iceberg. Now doesn't matter. As far as stopping and can't stop them. No, who is the captain? It's not going to go down. So what's the answer? What do you do when you're on a sinking ship? What's the answer? To the ocean waves? what's coming next, the power links in this world would want us to be weak, be desperate. So when the stakes and the crashes, they will come rescue us. What's going to be their rescue plan? Take us up for you in in in via it's gonna be a worldwide version of the fact that the Federal Reserve's hard to deal with weightless on a worldwide basis to what they're auditing for them repealing it. So the answer really is is to get off the business Titanic. The opposite of that they have created is crashing. They're <CAREvice>killing</CAREvice> it on purpose to replace misleading <CAREvice>wars</CAREvice>. So the answer is, is to get back to the USS Constitution. Again, before we're supposed to be million in the first place, Paul, all he says is open the constitution and read it. As Michael Walzer earlier, we're supposed to be sovereign states. That is the bedrock of this country. People tend to focus on washington dc too much. Focus on your states, first and foremost. Without keywords, we've been outreaching to the current serving police and military because we don't understand how our is this is constitution triage, are trying to deal with the guy that the guns shooting, you are violating your <FAIRNESSvirtue>rights</FAIRNESSvirtue> and giving you more time, why don't you some time to restore their public, we just launched a new app called Operation sleeping giant banner there. And the focus there is reach out to veterans, get them to understand how late the hour is, and that their responsibilities under oath are not satisfied just by voting. Certainly it's important to go well goes till the veterans. If you vote for another breakup, what does that make you? breaker was not enough. We got to revitalize institutions have a free Republic. And that is good to have <CAREvirtue>security</CAREvirtue> in ourselves in our <LOYALTYvirtue>communities</LOYALTYvirtue>. at every level, we're talking about food <CAREvirtue>security</CAREvirtue>, it used to be in this country at three years when the brain during the Cold <CAREvirtue>War</CAREvirtue>. It's cheap green reserves. Now there's only enough grain to feed every one of us as well, local bread. So you're wanting to do it yourselves. Make sure you've got food storage, what's coming up should be number one. priority number one, you can revise food harder to grow gardens, called Victory Gardens. If you want to make sure you're self sufficient in your <LOYALTYvirtue>communities</LOYALTYvirtue>, support your local farmers and co ops resist any federal attempts to intervene with your capacity to grow your own food. You should be ready to <CAREvice>fight</CAREvice> over that as much as you can good <CAREvice>fight</CAREvice> over gun confiscation. Your food is essential. Next one after that you got to have physical <CAREvirtue>security</CAREvirtue> got to make sure you're <CAREvirtue>secure</CAREvirtue>. What is the <CAREvirtue>security</CAREvirtue> of a free state? What is it? The militia is supposed to be us. But we're here to talk about this for years is the only time when the constitution when the word necessary is used. The militia is necessary for <CAREvirtue>security</CAREvirtue> for free state, you will not be <CAREvirtue>secure</CAREvirtue> and you will not be free that you got to revitalizing the state level get on politics but also as individuals starting to watch it <LOYALTYvirtue>together</LOYALTYvirtue> all the veterans in the <LOYALTYvirtue>community</LOYALTYvirtue>. I go to the sheriff, the sheriff, here's your posse. When times get tough. When times get tough. We'll be here to back you up here and make sure you get a squared away constitutional Sheriff and have actually navigated for quite a long time, you shouldn't have got screwed is sound money, financial <CAREvirtue>security</CAREvirtue>, the rest of the world recovering from the VR system already, China, Russia, Brazil, India already started to separate themselves $1 we needed to come from it also, to put yourself in the system, when it crashes, you are preserved, and you're getting back to constitutional money at the state level, that's essential. If we don't have that system in place when the US collapses, that will be desperate and more vulnerable. The martial <AUTHORITYvirtue>law</AUTHORITYvirtue> and more likely the military and police will go along with it is also perceived as a real emergency. Make sure you're scoring away in yourselves, your neighborhoods, your counties and your states so that when the time comes, and they try to pull that nonsense, and try and learn martial <AUTHORITYvirtue>law</AUTHORITYvirtue>, there's nowhere in our Constitution, then that the police and military will say, wait a minute, Mr. President, they don't need us, not desperate, but not hungry, and and tell them to stay out of their sovereign state, they're more likely to say no, those unconstitutional orders. And the last one is the state sovereignty. That's the answer. Don't turn to a military coup to solve your problems. Lots of emails with folks be like, Oh, you tell us what you won't do. What are you going to watch on DC? What's the military going to go <SANCTITYvirtue>clean</SANCTITYvirtue> out that <CAREvice>damaged</CAREvice> Vipers. And my response to them is go look and see what Jefferson and Madison told us was a solution. As Michael Bolton said this little while ago, the solution is is the states must interpose themselves between the people and personally federal government that has broken the chains of the Constitution, the state's most important. One message for the Republican Party. This is your last chance. If you screw this up, then you will deserve it, you will get the deputy republican party because american people will not take it again. We cannot afford one more cycle of fake constitutionalist one more cycle of compromising on the Constitution. Unless my party wants me to do otherwise, honestly, I have a deal to make in the back room, you must support and <CAREvirtue>defend</CAREvirtue> it. If you compromise on the Constitution. As I take a little bit of poison. If I take half a glass of poison, I'm still poisoning myself. We can't afford anymore. Lady Liberty has already had multiple doses of poison whether it's Democrat or Republican administration, they've been poisoned or a death slowly. And she's at the last her last breath one more dose and she'll be dead. So do not do not. Well, we'll see what they do. But if they do come with rewards, they will deserve to die. We'll place them on the wings were replaced. So but I encourage all of you personal responsibility for your own <CAREvirtue>security</CAREvirtue>. Don't just play politics. Get yourself ready. A storm is coming. Get back on the Constitution. And let's write it out. by South Carolina General president is registered here. He's a retired major US Army Special Forces. And he's going to lead us with Oh ceremony if you don't want to support the Constitution, but not your right not to require the government officials because the spring ball away. You don't have to get up to it. But for those of you who are prior service military with renew your records you'd like to join us if you never even started before at all, but you want to get over to support <CAREvirtue>defend</CAREvirtue> the constitution along with us. And we encourage you to join us those reps brought to you as you year the tea party rally I apologize sincerely from my heart. And I was not from South Carolina. I'm sorry. I'm from Georgia. There's only one reason I'm in South Carolina and that's because Georgia boys are smart. And they know that school teachers in South Carolina are better looking than the ones in Georgia. So I'm better. And now I live in Gaffney. And I'm routed represent both users and meetings all over the state. I took this over September the 15th. It will be 44 years ago. I was 18 years old. I was scared to death and did not understand all aspects of it at the time. I did not understand that it was by the Constitution, about the constitution and for the Constitution. I learned I heard it, I took it, it meant something to me. I know that this did not expire at the end of the <AUTHORITYvirtue>duty</AUTHORITYvirtue> day. It did not expire at the end of my career. It is a no take to my grave. I want to offer it to you those that are interested. I don't believe in making anybody take an oath. It's voluntary. It's number two, the one I took is scared to death. 18 year old kid 44 years ago, it's easy to just stand up, you raise your arm. I stay aligned, you repeated. The part that most people mess up is the main part. I will say I asked you to state your full name. Include that minimal name that your <AUTHORITYvirtue>mother</AUTHORITYvirtue> gave you that you don't like very much. State your name. In the short clauses you repeat, and it's done. All those who want to take you please state get that right arm. stand proud a little higher than usual try to get an extra quarter inch is just repeat after me. I state your full name. Do solemnly swear or affirm that I will support and <CAREvirtue>defend</CAREvirtue> the Constitution of the United States of America. Against all <LOYALTYvice>enemies</LOYALTYvice>, <LOYALTYvice>foreign</LOYALTYvice> and domestic That I will bear true faith and <AUTHORITYvirtue>allegiance</AUTHORITYvirtue> to the same thing. And then I take this obligation freely. Without any mental reservation or purpose, everyday purpose everything ledgering my life my fortune and my <SANCTITYvirtue>sacred</SANCTITYvirtue> <AUTHORITYvirtue>honor</AUTHORITYvirtue> is my fourth favorite <AUTHORITYvirtue>honor</AUTHORITYvirtue> .
